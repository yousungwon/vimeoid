# Android client for Vimeo.com service #
(in development)

  * _Works with_: Android 1.6+
  * _Gives_: VimeoProvider

## Important Notice ##

Now there is no possibility to play videos using mobile devices directly from vimeo.com and they started to block IPs who try to make it (because mobile versions are allowed only for Plus paid members and it is only possible to play them from their site). So there is no mean to continue this project. Though you can use it as a good (I hope) example for your Android applications.
